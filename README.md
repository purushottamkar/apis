Code for APIS [Mukhoty, B., Dutta, S. & Kar, P. Robust non-parametric regression via incoherent subspace projections. Mach Learn (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06045-z]
The application of APIS is demonstrated in three areas:

1. **Robust non-parametric Kernel Regression:**
The *ker_reg* folder contains four jupyter notebook files applying APIS for functions shown in Fig. 3 of the paper.

2. **Robust Linear Regression:**
The *lin_reg* folder contains two jupyter notebook files applying APIS for robust linear regression setting in Fig. 4.

3. **Image Denoising:** 
In the img folder, the *fourier_cann_sp.ipynb* file gives APIS for adversarial salt-pepper corruption as reported in Fig. 6 and *fourier_wavelet_block.ipynb* gives APIS for block corruption as reported in Fig. 7. Additionally, the *image_noise.ipynb* file gives code for introducing these corruption.
